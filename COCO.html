            the Day of the Dead, Miguel inadvertently bumps the family ofrenda and breaks a frame containing a photo of
            Imelda and an infant Coco. He discovers a hidden section of the photograph that shows his
            great-great-grandfather (whose head has been torn from the photo) holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Believing
            this proves Ernesto is his relative, Miguel excitedly tells his family about his musical aspirations. In
            response, Miguel's grandmother destroys his guitar.
            Distraught, Miguel breaks into Ernesto's mausoleum and takes his guitar to use in a local talent
            competition. Once Miguel strums it, he becomes invisible to all living people. However, he can interact with
            his skeletal dead relatives, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back
            with them, they realize Imelda cannot visit since Miguel removed her photo from the ofrenda. Miguel also
            discovers that he has been cursed for stealing from the dead: he must receive a family blessing to return to
            the living world before sunrise or he will remain in the Land of the Dead forever. Imelda offers him a
            blessing on the condition that he abandons music, but Miguel refuses and seeks Ernesto's blessing instead.
            Miguel encounters Héctor, a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once performed with Ernesto. Héctor offers to
            bring Miguel to Ernesto in exchange for Miguel placing his photo on an ofrenda so he can visit his daughter
            before she forgets him, which would cause him to fade from existence. Héctor helps Miguel perform in a
            talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel flees after being discovered by his family.
            Miguel sneaks into Ernesto's mansion and is welcomed by a surprised Ernesto, but Héctor appears and accuses
            Ernesto of stealing his songs. As the two argue, Miguel slowly pieces together the truth: Ernesto and Héctor
            were once a musical act on the brink of fame until Héctor grew homesick and tried to leave. Unable to write
            songs himself, Ernesto poisoned Héctor and stole his guitar and songs to pass off as his own. To protect his
            legacy, Ernesto seizes Héctor's photo and has Miguel and Héctor thrown into a cenote pit. There, Miguel
            realizes Héctor is his actual great-great-grandfather and that Coco is Héctor's daughter.
            After being rescued by his family, Miguel reveals the truth about Héctor's death, and Imelda and Héctor
            reconcile. The family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve Héctor's photo. Ernesto's crimes are exposed
            to the audience, who quickly turn on him, and he is crushed by a falling bell (mirroring his fate in real
            life), although Héctor's photograph is lost in the chaos. As the sun rises, Imelda and a fading Héctor bless
            Miguel and return him to the living world.
            Back home, Miguel apologizes to his family for running away and plays "Remember Me" on Héctor's guitar,
            brightening Coco to sing along with him. She shares that she kept the torn piece of the photo with Héctor's
            face, then tells her family stories about her father, preserving his memory as well as his existence in the
            Land of the Dead. Miguel reconciles with his family, ending the ban on music.
            One year later, Miguel shows his new baby sister, Socorro, the family ofrenda, now displaying photos of
            Héctor and the recently deceased Coco. Coco's collected letters from Héctor prove Ernesto's theft of his
            songs, leading to Ernesto's disgrace and Héctor's rightful recognition. In the Land of the Dead, Héctor
            joins Imelda, Coco, and their family for a visit to the living world. Miguel performs a heartfelt song for
            his relatives, living and dead.</div>
